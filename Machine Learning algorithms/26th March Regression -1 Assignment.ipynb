    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to be valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. This means that changes in the independent variables should result in proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence of errors**: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. There should be no correlation between consecutive residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be uniform along the range of predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of residuals**: The residuals should be normally distributed. This assumption ensures that the estimates of the coefficients are unbiased and have the minimum variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Residual plots**: Plot the residuals against the predicted values or against each independent variable. This helps visualize linearity and homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normality tests**: Conduct statistical tests like Shapiro-Wilk test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, or visual inspection like QQ plot to assess the normality of residuals.\n",

    "5. **Cook's distance and leverage**: These measures help identify influential data points that may disproportionately affect the regression model.\n",

    "1. **Flexibility**: Polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables more effectively than linear regression. It can model complex curves and patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Fit**: By introducing higher-order polynomial terms, polynomial regression can provide a better fit to the data, resulting in a lower residual sum of squares (RSS) or higher R-squared value compared to linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Transformation Required**: In cases where the relationship between the variables is inherently non-linear, polynomial regression eliminates the need for data transformation, which may be necessary in linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression compared to Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting**: Polynomial regression with higher-order terms may lead to overfitting, especially if the model captures noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. This can result in poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretability**: As the degree of the polynomial increases, the interpretation of coefficients becomes more complex, making it challenging to explain the relationship between variables to non-technical stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Requirement**: Polynomial regression may require larger sample sizes compared to linear regression, especially for higher-order polynomials, to avoid overfitting and instability in parameter estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Prefer Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linear Relationships**: When the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is non-linear, polynomial regression is preferred over linear regression as it can capture the curvature and complexity of the relationship more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Polynomial regression can be useful in exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that may not be captured by linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Small to Moderate Degree Polynomials**: Polynomial regression with small to moderate degree polynomials (e.g., quadratic or cubic) can often strike a balance between flexibility and complexity, providing a better fit to the data without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Engineering and Physical Sciences**: Polynomial regression is commonly used in engineering and physical sciences where non-linear relationships are prevalent, such as modeling temperature-pressure relationships, growth curves, or mechanical stress-strain relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while polynomial regression offers greater flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships compared to linear regression, it also comes with the risk of overfitting and reduced interpretability. It is best suited for situations where the relationship between variables is inherently non-linear and requires a more flexible modeling approach."
